# Project Yandex Praktikum "Russian Travel"

## Description

This is a repository which contains my third practical project work at [Yandex Praktikum "Frontend Developer"](https://practicum.yandex.ru/web/) course. At the moment the source code of this repo represents adaptive html/css techniques to follow *rubber layout* approach.

## Technologies used

In order to make the layout "rubber" I used `@media` queries and put down a set of break points for different screen widths: 1280px, 1024px, 768px, 320px. Here for the main part of the web site I used `grid` for the proper layout.
